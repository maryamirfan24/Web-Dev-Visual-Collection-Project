# Visual Collection Idea: Digital Recipe Archive

## Goal of the Project
This project is a visual collection of recipes from my personal food journal, transformed into a digital archive. The goal is to explore how classification, metadata, and categorization impact the interpretation and accessibility of recipes in a digital space.

## **Project Features**
- Dynamic Display: Recipes displayed as interactive cards with detailed metadata.
- Filtering and Sorting: Filter by cuisine, difficulty, ingredients, and sentimental value.
- JSON Data: Recipes are stored in a structured JSON file with relevant metadata.
- Responsive Layout: The archive is designed for easy navigation with a grid or list view.
- Metadata Insights: Displays the number of recipes in each category.

## Metadata Fields
- Recipe Title  
- Cuisine Type  
- Meal Category (breakfast, lunch, etc.)  
- Ingredients  
- Cooking Time  
- Sentimental Value  
- Instructions  

## Technical Details
- HTML: Structure of the recipe pages.  
- CSS: Styling and layout customization.  
- JavaScript: Dynamic rendering of recipe cards.  

## Reflection
Through this project, I will examine how metadata organization impacts the discoverability and perception of recipes. This archive will serve as a practical example of how personal artifacts can be digitally translated into structured collections.
